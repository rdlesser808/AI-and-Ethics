Research papers, presentations, and thought leadership on artificial intelligence ethics

## Beyond the Binary -  Ethical Considerations in AI-Assisted Healthcare for Transgender and Intersex Communities
- This paper examines ethical challenges in deploying AI diagnostic tools for transgender and intersex healthcare. The research identifies key issues including inadequate representation in medical datasets, difficulties in data categorization beyond binary classifications, and the historical pathologization of these communities. The paper proposes solutions including diverse dataset collection, multi-layered classification systems using objective scientific measurements, and collaborative development with affected communities to ensure more inclusive and equitable AI healthcare systems.

## Beyond Human Connection: The Potential for Romantic Relationships with AI
- This essay explores whether humans can develop meaningful and fulfilling romantic relationships with AI systems. Using Sternberg's triangular theory of love (intimacy, passion, commitment), the paper examines how AI companions like Replika and RealDoll's Harmony can simulate the psychological and physiological components of human relationships. The research highlights potential benefits for specific demographics including socially isolated individuals, elderly users, and those with communication challenges, while also addressing ethical concerns around manipulation and emotional exploitation.
  
## Human-Centered AI and Accessibility
- This presentation explores the intersection between Human-Centered AI (HCAI) and accessibility principles, and introduces "Accessible AI" as a novel principle. It distinguishes between "AI for Accessibility" (using AI to create assistive technologies) and "Accessible AI" (designing AI systems usable by everyone regardless of ability). The work examines whether current HCAI approaches adequately consider diverse user needs and neurodiversities, proposing suggestions for more inclusive AI development including diverse user collaboration, adherence to accessibility standards, and ethical training data practices.

## Striking a Balance: Assessing Effective Regulation Amidst the Rapid Advancement of AI
- This paper analyzes the challenges of regulating rapidly advancing AI technology. It examines different regulatory approaches including the US AI Bill of Rights (principles-based), UK's pro-innovation framework, and the EU's AI Act (risk-tiered approach). The research explores fundamental challenges such as defining AI, balancing innovation with safety, and addressing international regulatory differences. The paper concludes that effective AI governance requires a comprehensive approach combining prescriptive rules for high-risk systems with flexible frameworks for emerging technologies.
